        <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>

        <p class="one">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

            <p>Verified Graduate</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</p>

        <p> ‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
          for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</p>
      </div>

            <p> Verified Graduate</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>

        <p> ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
          100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>

        <p> An overall wonderful and rewarding experience</p>

        <p>‚Äú Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I really enjoy, and make a good living
          while doing something I love. ‚Äù</p>

        <p> Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
          learning from their experiences was easy.</p>

        <p>‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
          gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
          an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>
